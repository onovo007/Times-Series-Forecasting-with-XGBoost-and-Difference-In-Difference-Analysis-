## Project Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for forecasting viral load suppression trends using advanced machine learning techniques. The main objectives are:

- To demonstrate the application of XGBoost for time-series forecasting.
- To assess the impact of interventions using Difference-in-Difference (DiD) analysis.
- To provide reproducible workflows in Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization.

## Key Features

- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Predicts future VLS trends up to 2030.
- **XGBoost Implementation:** Utilizes the powerful XGBoost algorithm for accurate predictions.
- **Difference-In-Difference Analysis:** Evaluates the effects of interventions or policy changes.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes plots and charts to interpret results.
